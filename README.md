## Hi there 👋 

I'm Muthukrishnan, a passionate Chemical Engineer with 5 years of experience in the energy industry. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

This repository is a collection of Python code snippets aimed at simplifying tasks like typical Python commands, creating graphs, and visualizing data using libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly. If you're looking to transition from Excel to Python for graphing, I'm here to help you with that!  

🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning with **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras** to enhance my data-driven problem-solving skills.

## Key Areas of Focus:

- **Python programming** for data analysis and visualization  
- Transitioning from Excel to Python for powerful graphing  
- Machine learning with Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras  

## Languages and Tools:

- **Python**  
- **JMP**  
- **MATLAB**  
- **HTML/CSS**
